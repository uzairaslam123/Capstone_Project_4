## Introduction<a name="introduction"></a>
# Project Overview
This is the fourth and the final project  of my Udacity Data Science Nano Degree. In this project i have answered some business questions following the CRISP-DM approach, about Airbnb properties in Amsterdam. The motivation of this project came from the first project of my Udacity Nano Degree where i explroed the data set of Airbnb Berlin but i did not go into too many details because of some limitations, one of them being time. As we were flexible with the selection of our Capstone project, i decided to use the knowledge i have learnt throught this nano degree to dig deeper into the same project but this time i decided to use the data set of Airbnb Amsterdam and i also investigated more than one type of machine learning model e.g. Linear Regression, ADABoost and RandomForest. I think overall, this project helped me understand and apply the concepts that i really wanted to after i finihsed my first project with Airbnb Berlin dataset. 

Whenever you, as a traveller, plan to travel to a new city, you look for the best possible accomodation. everyone has their own definition of 'best' but i thought of the following three questions

1. **Which neighbourhoods are most popular for Airbnb locations in Berlin?**
2. **What is the average price of Airbnb in Berlin?**
3. **What features influence the price?**

I have answered my questions using the listing Data that was provided by Airbnb. You will find the code and the conclusions of all the abov mentioned questions, in their respective notebooks. 



## Installation<a name="installation"></a>

The Jupyter Notebooks demonstrated in this repository were created using python version 3.

Libraries and the packages used for **Data Processings** are:

- Pandas
- Numpy

For **Visualizing** i used the following:

- Matplotlib
- seaborn


For **Modelling** i used the following:

- Sklearn
- Scipy



## File Descriptions<a name="descriptions"></a>

In this repository I have uploaded three jupyter notebooks, 1 Readme file and 1 Dataset.

The files are descibed below.
- **Project_4_Airbnb_Amsterdam.ipynb**: In this file i have answered all my three questions following the CRISP_DM approach and using the listing database. In the file you will find preprocessing of the data along with Graphs and the conclusions at the end.


- **listing.csv**: This is the official dataset of Airbnb Berlin listing.

## Conclusion<a name="conclusion"></a>
I have written my conclusion for each question in their respective jupyter notebook.

## Licensing, Authors, and Acknowledgments<a name="licensing"></a>

This project was made possible by Airbnb for providing the dataset, by Udacity, for providing us such a great platform for learning.
Feel free to use my code in any of your projects

Enjoyyy.
